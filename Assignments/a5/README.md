# Assignment 5

## General Premise

Complete the proofs and responses, respectively, for each question in the assignment. 
All questions hold a weight of four (4) points with the exception of questions 7-10, being worth 3.75 points each.

## Multiple PDFs

There are three (3) variants of the same PDF for A5.

- no input fields add
- response input fields only
- proof and response input fields

You only need to submit one completed PDF. The options are there for those who have hardship with editing a PDF.

## Grading

Grading is done manually, based on capture fields embedded within the PDF. Failure to properly submit the PDF with your annotated responses will result in an *_as-is_* assessment based on the outcomes within the capture fields.
