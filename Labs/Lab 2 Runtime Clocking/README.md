 # Lab 02: Runtime Clocking

Welcome to the second Data Structures Lab! The goal of this lab will be to familiarize yourself with the differences in runtime for various functions and provide a basis for the study of various concepts within 212. **Be sure to read and follow all instructions unless otherwise specified. Record your answers to the questions for submission in Gradescope** You'll find the table of contents for this lab below.

 # Part 1. Rules

 ## Rules

 1. Google it!
    - TAs are not your personal encyclopedia/knowledge base/code guru, etc. nor do we have the entirety of a language's libraries & their function's argument list memorized. We should not be your first stop when you get stuck on syntax. If you are having trouble finding a solution to your problem or finding/understanding the documentation that is a different story and we will be more than happy to assist. Expect the question "What have you googled?" to be asked from us throughout the semester.

 # Part 2. Runtime differences

 The two mathematical equations that will be used in order to display the run time differences between more and less efficient implementations are finding Euler's number (e) and calculating Fibonacci numbers. You will be required to record the times of the various versions of both mathematical equations with  https://chart-studio.plot.ly/create/#/ . This is a website that allows you to very easily plot graphs via the input of a CSV file (Comma Separated Value). Creating this file will be explained later on. 

 ## 2.1 Euler's Number (e)

 ### What is Euler's number? 

 Euler's number (e), is a mathematical constant that is the base of the natural logarithm. This number is approximately equal to 2.71828. This number comes from Leonhard Euler (1707 - 1783). He was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, geographer, logician, and engineer who made important and influential discoveries in many branches of mathematics. Another interesting fact on Euler is that he lost vision in his right eye early on in his career, he blamed it on his tendency to overwork himself while working on cartography for Petersburg Academy. This didn't stop him because 25 years later, he lost vision in his other eye for the same reason. 

 ### Euler(e) calculation functions 

 **Algorithm 1 for Euler's number**

 ```c++
 long double euler1(int n) {
     long double sum = 0;
     long double fact;
     for (int i = 0 ; i <= n ; i ++) {
         fact = 1;
         for (int j = 2 ; j <= i ; j++) {
             fact *= j;
         }
         sum += (1.0 / fact);
     }
 
     return sum;
 }
 ```

 **Algorithm 2 for Euler's number**

 ```c++
 long double euler2(int n) {
     long double sum = 0;
     long double fact = 1;
 
     for (int i = 0 ; i <= n ; i++) {
         sum += (1.0 / fact);
         fact *= (i+1);
     }
 
     return sum;
 }
 ```

 ### Function for Timing

 In order to be able to use the clock function you will **need to include the ctime library** in your program. This will allow for you to input the number you would like to calculate and the algorithm you would like to check. This code will not automatically create a file for you to submit to the plotting website. It is meant to allow you to compare the runtimes for a specific number between algorithms. 

 ```c++
 void time_func(uint16_t n, const char *name) {
 
     uint64_t val;
 
     unsigned long c_start, c_end;
 
     if (! strcmp(name, "euler1")) {
         c_start = std::clock();
         val = euler1(n);
         c_end = std::clock();
 
     }
     else if (! strcmp(name, "euler2")) {
         c_start = std::clock();
         val = euler2(n);
         c_end = std::clock();
 
     }
     else{
         std::cout << "Invalid function call" << std::endl;
 
     }
 
     float output = 1.0 * (c_end - c_start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
     std::cout << name << " euler(" << n << "):\t";
     std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(4) << output << " Output: " << val << std::endl;
 }
 ```

 **Main Function**

 ```c++
 int main(int argc, char**argv) {
     if (argc != 3) {
         std::cout << "Usage: ./euler <n <alg\n";
         std::cout << "\t<n\tn-th term to be calculated\n";
         std::cout << "\t<alg\talgorithm to be used (euler1 or euler2)\n";
         return 0;
         
     }
 
     uint16_t n = (uint16_t) atoi(argv[1]);
     time_func(n, argv[2]);
 }
 
 ```

 Put the above functions into your ide and answer the questions that follow:

 :white_check_mark: Question 1. Play around with some small values of n. What is the first value of n that causes notably slower runtime for euler1?

 :white_check_mark: Question 2. What is the first value of n that causes notably slower runtime for euler2?

 ### Euler Runtime up to X numbers

 For this portion of the lab you **need to include the cstring library**

 As a disclaimer the functions euler1 and euler2 will not be changing for this section. However the time_func and main function will. The time_func will only differ slightly as you must change the return type to a float and then return the time output. 

 The purpose of this section is to restructure the previous section's handout so that it prints several values and their runtimes to the terminal, in order to see how runtime costs increase.

 For example if you enter ./euler 5 euler1, it will calculate and print euler(0) followed by euler(1) up to and including euler(5) and it will also calculate the time required to perform the calculation per value. 

 **Function for Timing**

 ```c++
 float time_func(uint16_t n, const char *name) {
     uint64_t val;
     unsigned long c_start, c_end;
 
     if (! strcmp(name, "euler1")) {
         c_start = std::clock();
         val = euler1(n);
         c_end = std::clock();
 
     }
     else if (! strcmp(name, "euler2")) {
         c_start = std::clock();
         val = euler2(n);
         c_end = std::clock();
 
     }
     else{
         std::cout << "Invalid function call" << std::endl;
         return 0;
 
     }
     
     float output = 1.0 * (c_end - c_start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
     return output;
 }
 
 ```

 **Main Function**

 ```c++
 int main(int argc, char**argv) {
     if (argc != 3) {
         std::cout << "Usage: ./euler <n <alg\n";
         std::cout << "\t<n\tn-th term to be calculated\n";
         std::cout << "\t<alg\talgorithm to be used (euler1 or euler2)\n";
         return 0;
     }
 
     uint16_t Max_Number = (uint16_t) atoi(argv[1]);
     
     for (int i = 0; i <= Max_Number; i++){
 
         float function_time = time_func(i, argv[2]);
         std::cout << argv[2] << "("<< i << ") Runtime took " << std::fixed << std::setprecision(4) << function_time << " Seconds\n";
         
     }
 
     return 0;
 }
 ```

 :white_check_mark: Question 3. Use the above code to compare the two Euler functions. Which function is faster? Why is it faster than the other?

 ## 2.2 Fibonacci

 ### What is Fibonacci? 

 Fibonacci is a mathematical formula that is used to calculate a number by adding the previous two numbers in order to form the next number. Leonardo Pisano (1170 - 1250) was an Italian mathematician who was most famous for his work with the Fibonacci Sequence. Unlike Leonhard Euler, he spent all his time as a mathematician, also unlike Euler, he maintained his vision.

 ### Fibonacci Runtime for specific numbers 

 **Algorithm 1 for Fibonacci**

 ```c++
 uint64_t fib_r(uint16_t n) {
     if (n < 2) {
         return n;
 
     } 
     else {
         return fib_r(n-1) + fib_r(n-2);
 
     }
 }
 ```

 **Algorithm 2 for Fibonacci**

 ```c++
 uint64_t fib_i(uint16_t n) {
 
     uint64_t sum;
     uint64_t prev[] = {0, 1};
 
     if (n < 2) {
         return n;
 
     }
 
     for (uint16_t i = 2 ; i <= n ; i++ ) {
         sum = prev[0] + prev[1];
         prev[0] = prev[1];
         prev[1] = sum;
 
     }
     return sum;
 }
 ```

 :white_check_mark: Question 4. Which function do you expect to run faster? Why?

 **Function for Timing**

         c_start = std::clock();
         val = fib_i(n);
         c_end = std::clock();
 
     }
     else if (! strcmp(name, "fib_r")) {
         c_start = std::clock();
         val = fib_r(n);
         c_end = std::clock();
 
     }
     else{
         std::cout << "Invalid function call" << std::endl;
         return;
 
     }
     
     float output = 1.0 * (c_end - c_start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
     std::cout << name << " fib(" << n << "):\t";
     std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(4) << output << " Output: " << val << std::endl;
 }
 ```

 **Main Function**

 ```c++
 int main(int argc, char**argv) {
     if (argc != 3) {
         std::cout << "Usage: ./fib <n <alg\n";
         std::cout << "\t<n\tn-th term to be calculated\n";
         std::cout << "\t<alg\talgorithm to be used (fib_r or fib_i)\n";
         return 0;
         
     }
 
     uint16_t n = (uint16_t) atoi(argv[1]);
     time_func(n, argv[2]);
 }
 
 ```

 :white_check_mark: Question 5. Use the above code to compare the two Fibonacci functions on similar inputs. Which function was faster? Why do you think it is faster than the other?

 ### Fibonacci Runtime up to X numbers 

 For this portion of the lab you **need to include the fstream and cstring libraries** 

 As a disclaimer the functions fib_i and fib_r will not be changing for this section. However the time_func and main function will. The time_func will only differ slightly as you must change the return type to a float and then return the time output. 

 The purpose of this section is to restructure the code from the previous section to create a csv file that you will be able to input into the graphing website. This program will create a CSV file that contains the Fibonacci number for every number up to your input. 

 For example if you enter ./fib 5 fib_r, it will calculate fib(0), fib(1), ..., fib(5) and it will also calculate the time per value. 

 **Function for Timing**

 ```c++
 float time_func(uint16_t n, const char *name) {
 uint64_t val;
     unsigned long c_start, c_end;
     if (! strcmp(name, "fib_i")) {
         c_start = std::clock();
         val = fib_i(n);
         c_end = std::clock();
 
     }
     else if (! strcmp(name, "fib_r")) {
         c_start = std::clock();
         val = fib_r(n);
         c_end = std::clock();
 
     }
     else{
         std::cout << "Invalid function call" << std::endl;
 
     }
 
     float output = 1.0 * (c_end - c_start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;;
     return output;
 }
 
 ```

 **Main Function**

 ```c++
 int main(int argc, char**argv) {
     if (argc != 3) {
         std::cout << "Usage: ./fib <n <alg\n";
         std::cout << "\t<n\tn-th term to be calculated\n";
         std::cout << "\t<alg\talgorithm to be used (fib_r or fib_i)\n";
         return 0;
     }
 
     uint16_t Max_Number = (uint16_t) atoi(argv[1]);
     std::ofstream myfile;
     
     myfile.open(std::to_string(Max_Number)+ "_" + (char *)argv[2]+".csv");
 
     myfile << "input" << "," << "time" << '\n';
 
     for (int i = 0; i <= Max_Number; i++){
         float function_time = time_func(i, argv[2]);
         myfile << i << "," << std::fixed << std::setprecision(4) << function_time<<'\n';
         
     }
     myfile.close();
     return 0;
 }
 
 ```

  The code above can be used to generate a csv for upload to the plot.ly website.

  :white_check_mark: Question 6.Modify the above code to work for the Euler functions from the previous program. 

 # Part 3. Line Graphs

 Once you have the required csv files you will need to go to https://chart-studio.plot.ly/create/#/ . 

 Once you're on this website you will click the import button that is located at the top right of the windows browser. You will then click upload and upload the csv file you would like to display. 

 After this is complete you will click the trace button. Here you will be able to select what you want to display on your x and y axis. Display input for the x axis and time for the y axis. 

 When you're uploading another csv to this website you will repeat the same steps above. 

 The final deliverable for this lab will include an image of the graph you make to show the differences in runtime. This will require an account with plot.ly to save the image or alternatively you could use the snipping tool to take a screenshot of your plot.

 # Part 4. Max Subsequence Sum

 Now that you've had some experience timing functions, lets try something different. Here are four samples of code that all solve the same problem. These should look familiar, as we discussed a similar problem & went over a few solutions during last week's lecture.

The 'Max Subsequence Sum' problem is the task of finding a contiguous subsequence of the largest sum of a sequence of n numbers. In other words were you to make 2 cuts into the sequence, what is the highest the sum of all numbers between those cuts could be? For each function, read through and make a prediction on how fast each will run.

 If it helps you to follow the code, all functions listed will return '11' for the array {4, -3, 5 -2, -1, 2, 6, -2} (everything except the -2 at the end.)

 ```c++
 int MaxSubSum1(std::vector<int> a) {
 	int maxSum = 0;
 	for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); ++i) {
 		for (int j = 1; j < a.size(); ++j) {
 			int thisSum = 0;
 
 			for (int k = i; k <= j; ++k) {
 				thisSum += a[k];
 			}
 
 			if (thisSum  maxSum) {
 				maxSum = thisSum;
 			}
 		}
 	}
 	return maxSum;
 }
 ```

 ```c++
 int MaxSubSum2(std::vector<int> a) {
 	int maxSum = 0;
 
 	for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); ++i) {
 		int thisSum = 0;
 
 		for (int j = i; j < a.size(); ++j) {
 			thisSum += a[j];
 
 			if (thisSum  maxSum) {
 				maxSum = thisSum;
 			}
 		}
 	}
 	return maxSum;
 }
 ```

 ```c++
 int MaxSubSum3(std::vector<int> a){
     int sum = 0;
     int max_sum = 0;
     int min_sum = 0;
     int min_index = 0;
     int max_start = 0;
     int max_end = 0;
     
     for(unsigned int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++){
         sum += a[i];
         
         if(sum < min_sum){
             min_sum = sum;
             min_index = i;
         }
         
         if(sum - min_sum  max_sum){
             max_sum = sum - min_sum;
             max_start = min_index + 1;
             max_end = i + 1;
         }
     }
     return max_sum;
 }
 ```

 ```c++
 int MaxSubSum4(std::vector<int> a) {
 	int max_so_far = 0;
 	int max_ending_here = 0;
 
 	for (unsigned int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {
 		max_ending_here += a[i];
 
 		if (max_so_far < max_ending_here) {
 			max_so_far = max_ending_here;
 		}
 
 		if (max_ending_here < 0) {
 			max_ending_here = 0;
 		}
 	}
 	return max_so_far;
 }
 ```

 :white_check_mark: Question 7. Modify again your timing code to work for each of these functions, and graph them on https://chart-studio.plot.ly/create/#/. Do your graphs match what you expected?
